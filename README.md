# genDR-generif-analysis
[GenDR](http://genomics.senescence.info/diet/) is a database of genes thought to be related to the longevity-enhancing effects of dietary restriction. 
[GeneRIFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeneRIF) are short sentences describing the functions of genes.
My goal is to:
1. Use unsupervised machine learning techniques on the geneRIFs from the GenDR genes and see if any interesting clusters emerge.
2. Build a predictive model to separate DR-relevant geneRIFs from those that are unrelated, which I can then run on a larger set of geneRIFs to find potentially relevant genes that the GenDR database missed.
